#!/bin/bash

module load anaconda3   # this will allow conda to open anvio

conda activate anvio-7.1

echo "Anvi'o is now open, you can run your next command now."

# from here you can run whatever script you want- probably start with a file

# yay this bash script works!! (this file is mostly a test run for me and bash scripts)
